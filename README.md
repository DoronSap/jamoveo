Jamoveo is a real-time, web-based application that allows multiple users to sing and 
follow along with lyrics simultaneously — all synchronized by an admin.  
The app is designed for group singing, jam sessions, or karaoke-style activities, 
especially across different devices. 
The app includes two distinct entry points via separate URLs: 
• User Registration – For regular participants who will view the lyrics and sing 
along. 
• Admin Registration – For the session leader who selects the song and controls 
the flow.
